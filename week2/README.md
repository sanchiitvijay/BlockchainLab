# Setting up the Flask Blockchain

Follow these steps to set up and run the Flask-based blockchain:

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have `Python` and `pip` installed.

## 1. Install Flask
First, install Flask using pip:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

## 2. Create the Server Script
Create a `server.py` file. This script will define the basic blockchain structure and routes to interact with the blockchain, such as creating a new block and retrieving the entire blockchain.

## 3. Create the Client Script
Create a `client.py` file. This script will allow you to interact with the server, send data to create new blocks, and retrieve the entire blockchain.

## 4. Run the Server
Run the `server.py` script to start the Flask server:

```bash
python server.py
```

## 5. Run the Client
In another terminal, run the `client.py` script to interact with the server and create a blockchain:

```bash
python client.py
```

## 6. Result
A `blockchain.json` file will be created, and the blockchain will be printed in the terminal.
```

This markdown guide will now walk you through setting up and running the server and client for a basic Flask-based blockchain.
